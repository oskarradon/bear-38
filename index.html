      <h1>About this project</h1>
      <p>A/PART is issue #38 of The Bear magazine, formerly published as the Bear Deluxe, an independent, Pacific
      Northwest-based, nationally distributed magazine exploring environmental issues through the creative arts.</p>
      <p>This issue was created as a time capsule brimming not only with art, but with the stories of the humans making art in
      this moment (2020â€“2021). Rather than paint a broad picture, A/PART reveals bright glimpses of what it looks like to
      fight, to grieve, to celebrate, and to take up space. A/PART grapples with a sense of urgency at the intersections of
      place-based art, identity, and the environment in an expansive sense.</p>

      <p>Five creators served as sponsors and connectors to five artists who inspire them, a chance to reconnect or to build new
      relationships. Their works and words are woven together in conversation in these pages.</p>
